		<h2 id="header">Early Childhood</h2>
		<p id="content">Sir Robert Bryson Hall II was born on January 22, 1990, at Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland. He was born to Robert Bryson Hall,
			an African-American Maryland native, and a Caucasian mother. Logic spent much of his youth in the West Deer Park neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
			His father suffered from a cocaine addiction and his mother suffered from alcoholism. Despite his father initially being absent in his childhood,
			Logic was able to reconnect with Hall due to his rap career where he constantly talked about his dad and the things he did to his family, Logic goes on
			to play a recording of a voice mail he got from his dad where he asked Logic to stop talking about his addictions. During his early adolescent years,
			Logic witnessed his brothers produce and distribute crack cocaine to "addicts all over the block", including to his father. Logic maintains that he
			accurately knows how to manufacture and produce crack cocaine following these experiences.</p>
		<h2 id="header">Morals</h2>
		<p id="content">Logic is known to constantly talk about his view on people being treated the same,</p>
		<p id="content"> He does this by saying "People should be treated the same regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation"</p>
